    <h2>Welcome to Kashmir</h2>
    <p>
        Kashmir is a region known for its breathtaking landscapes, rich culture,
        and deep historical roots. For centuries, it has been a center of learning,
        spirituality, trade, and natural beauty.
    </p>

    <h2>Historical Background (Before 1947)</h2>
    <p>
        Before 1947, Jammu and Kashmir was a <strong>princely state</strong> during the period
        of British rule in the Indian subcontinent. It was governed by a local ruler
        (the Maharaja) and enjoyed internal autonomy, while external affairs were
        influenced by British paramountcy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jammu and Kashmir was <strong>not a part of British India</strong>, and it was
        <strong>not part of India or Pakistan</strong> before 1947. At the time of the
        partition of the subcontinent in August 1947, princely states were given the
        option to decide their future.
    </p>

    <h2>After 1947</h2>
    <p>
        Following the end of British rule in 1947, the region of Jammu and Kashmir
        became a subject of political dispute, shaping its modern history.
        This period marked a major turning point in the region’s political and social life.
    </p>

    <h2>Culture & Heritage</h2>
    <p>
        Kashmir has a unique cultural identity shaped by centuries of Hindu, Buddhist,
        and Islamic influences. Its traditions, languages, music, handicrafts,
        and cuisine reflect this diverse heritage.
